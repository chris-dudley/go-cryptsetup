  The go-cryptsetup package is designed to provide golang bindings to
  the cryptsetup library. The cryptsetup library is what provides
  access to encrypted hard drives on the linux kernel and provides
  some of the best encryption for protecting a hard drive from an
  attacker with physical access to the device (and not enough time for
  a full firmware hack plus arranging for the unsuspecting user to
  enter their password).

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
go get -u github.com/kcolford/go-cryptsetup
